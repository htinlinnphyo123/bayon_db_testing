{"_id":"H9eEgKoaK9NEGNuea","title":"$574M S’ville construction project sign of ‘rebound’","body":"A senior official of Preah Sihanouk province and a tourism sector representative regard the nearly $600 million investment by Ban Dao Investment Co Ltd for constructing a five-star hotel and commercial complex in Sihanoukville as a sign of confidence in the Cambodian economy and a response to the rebounding tourism sector.\n\nThe Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) recently granted a final certificate of registration for the company’s $574 million project which includes a hotel on Poy Tamong Beach Street in the provincial town’s Commune IV.\n\nDeputy provincial governor Long Dimanche told The Post on March 6 that he became aware of the investment after a recent CDC meeting.\n\nHe believes that the venture demonstrates the coastal province’s potential and its appeal for foreign investment.\n\n“This large investment project … will establish a five-star hotel with 2,870 rooms and a substantial commercial hub … indicating foreign investors’ trust in the region,” he said.\n\n“The project represents a major development for the province, enhancing its attractiveness, especially as we witness the gradual return of foreign tourists. The presence of the hotel and commercial hub will be crucial in providing services to visitors in Preah Sihanouk, contributing to tourism and our national economy,” he added.\n\nThourn Sinan, chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Cambodia chapter, noted that despite the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic downturn, the province remains a dynamic tourist and investment destination.\n\n“Despite the impact of Covid-19, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and global economic challenges, Preah Sihanouk, like Siem Reap, has suffered from a decrease in foreign tourists. However, the province continues to attract tourists and investors with its beautiful islands and beaches. Additionally, previously stalled investment projects are gradually resuming,” he said.\n\nGovernment intervention\n\nIn January, Prime Minister Hun Manet announced the launch of the Special Programme to Promote Investment in Preah Sihanouk Province for 2024, aiming to stimulate business activities and investments, transforming Preah Sihanouk into a province with substantial economic potential across various fields.\n\nThe initiative is structured around four main conceptual pillars: Repositioning the province’s image to highlight its role as an economic hub focused on industry, tourism and investment; addressing real challenges effectively and swiftly; introducing practical measures in alignment with the government’s policies and strategies; and accelerating digital and industrial development in the province to enhance value and competitive advantage.\n\nThe programme focuses on three key areas: initiating projects related to unfinished buildings, starting new ventures unrelated to unfinished construction and expanding existing investments, all set to commence within the year.\n\nDimanche observed a notable increase in investor interest following the premier’s announcement of the special package. He noted that four or five companies have already applied for investment, with many others in the process of research and preparing their applications for special investment rights.\n\n“So far, our team has processed a handful of applications from private sector companies. Two of these cases have undergone thorough review, discussion and evaluation by our team. We have offered incentive packages addressing fiscal and non-fiscal matters, in line with the private sector’s requests to commence investment activities [within the province],” he stated.\n\nHe added that the early 2024 construction and real estate situation has shown improvement compared to early 2023, though it has not reached the peak levels of pre-2019.\n\n“The construction and renovation activities, along with the arrangement of some buildings and sites for business and other investments in Preah Sihanouk, are showing positive trends, albeit gradual. The progress, while not rapid, is definitely beginning to gain momentum,” he explained.\n\nDimanche highlighted the presence of many large buildings in the province, noting that over 360 are unfinished and approximately 160-170 are completed but not yet operational. He expressed confidence that investment and construction there will accelerate in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n“We have high hopes that this special programme will significantly boost the confidence of both local and foreign investors to consider investing in Preah Sihanouk in 2024, with special exemptions. These provisions, both tax and non-tax, are greatly beneficial,” he stated.\n\nCr-Phnom Penh Post","type":"estate","countryCode":"KH","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725079300261"}},"createdUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR"}

However, he pointed out that the market for buying and selling land and retail space was still underperforming. \n\nSeap emphasised that the market is heavily influenced by global and regional economic growth and is currently not in a position to recover swiftly.\n\n“Everything always has a history and a journey. For the Cambodian real estate market, I believe improvement will come around 2026-27, possibly mirroring the peak conditions of 2018-19,” he stated.\n\nSeap, with nearly two decades of expertise in the field, commented that the situation in coastal Preah Sihanouk province, which currently has many unfinished projects, will eventually resolve.\n\n“The real estate and construction sector in [Preah Sihanouk] will experience rapid growth in the future. This belief is based on the patterns observed in the Chinese real estate market, where rapid development often begins in coastal cities,” he explained.\n\nAccording to Seap, the most promising real estate markets are those with well-developed transportation infrastructure, electricity, water, safety and the potential for owners to earn quick returns or high profits.\n\nIm Seng Hour, branch manager of Century 21 Zillion Holding in Sihanoukville town, noted that the gradual return of foreign investors, particularly from Indonesia and China, has reinvigorated some long-stalled construction sites. \n\nHe said these are now being rebuilt to accommodate the rising demand for rental space, though the buying and selling market remains sluggish.\n\n“Recently, I have seen previously abandoned buildings being renovated due to increased rental demand from Indonesian and Chinese investors, for both accommodation and business premises,” he said.\n\nSam Soknoeun, president of the Global Real Estate Association, mentioned that the Cambodian real estate market was muted in 2023. However, he expects a slight improvement this year as the government and private sector have been actively promoting and marketing to attract domestic and international investors. \n\nHe believes that investment in the country will create a demand for real estate and other buildings, aiding the gradual recovery of the market.\n\n“The real estate market in 2024 will improve marginally from 2023, driven by the growth of new ventures. Recovery in the real estate and construction sector usually takes longer than in other sectors,” Soknoeun added.","type":"estate","videoLink":null,"externalLink":null,"countryCode":"KH","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725079408633"}},"createdUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR"}
{"_id":"2LQaLMpbhzojFRaXC","title":"Will Cambodia’s Private Debt Become National Debt?","body":"Private debt, much of it concentrated in the rapidly deflating real estate sector, has already emerged as a political problem for Prime Minister Hun Manet.\n\nNot all is well in the Kingdom of Hun. Hun Manet, Cambodia’s new prime minister, who inherited the role from his father in August, prepares to meet with the business community on November 13 at the much-anticipated Government-Private Sector Forum. The government has been parlaying with business groups for months. But anger is brewing. The public is still angsty over possible tax rises. Hun Manet has denied that there will be any, but anyone who looks at his government’s Panglossian Pentagonal Strategy (an advanced economy by 2050!) knows that more tax is coming, as I argued here last month. I hear that a coterie of chambers of commerce has united to demand new reforms and guarantees from Hun Manet at the upcoming forum.\n\nMost likely, though, proceedings will be dominated by talk about the imposing property market and the encroaching disaster of private debt. Put simply, tens of billions of dollars of Chinese money poured into Cambodia in the 2010s, leading to a housing bubble and rampant speculation, primarily from Cambodia’s middle classes, who thought that Chinese funds and soaring prices would never dry up. Loans and mortgages were taken to purchase land and homes. But the COVID-19 pandemic and a drop off in private Chinese investment have resulted in falling property prices. See a fuller list here, but to give an example: the asking price of single villas has collapsed since 2020, falling from $2,000-2,500 per square meter to just over $1,000; average unit prices for twin villas have also fallen sharply.\n\nMost at risk are the property developers, many of whom have gone broke and cannot finish construction. However, some were also the providers of loans and mortgages to investors, raising questions about those liabilities if the developers fail. More worrying, many developers guarantee investors monthly yields. For instance, an investor buys a $50,000 apartment, and the developer guarantees $250 or so a month. Many Cambodians, including low-income households, thought these yields would repay their entire mortgages. It seemed a reasonable gamble. But many have ended up penniless while still owing repayments, leading to an untold number of personal tragedies.\n\nIndeed, the developers themselves were betting on being able to find renters (which is now difficult), and some now have to pay the yields out of their own pockets. Or, in some cases, not paying them at all. You know the situation is dire when the authorities start arresting oknhas. Perhaps as many as a dozen tycoons, including Hy Kimhong, director of Piphup Deimeas Investment and director of microfinance institution AMZ, have been arrested over alleged fraud, principally for owing tens of thousands of investors money.\n\nIt’s against this worrying background that we can turn to the banking sector in Cambodia. According to the World Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, published in October, domestic credit to the private sector stood at 182 percent of GDP, the highest rate of the Southeast Asian countries listed (and that was for 2022, the latest year on record). By comparison, in China, it was 220 percent. The deposit-to-loan ratio was just 80 percent for 2023, also the worst in the region and a fall of 13 percentage points from 2022. Liquid assets were just 18 percent of short-term liabilities, down 7 percentage points from 2022 and again the region’s worst.\n\n“The rapid credit growth and relatively high private sector debt, with concentration in real estate-related exposures pose key risks to Cambodia’s macro-financial stability,” the World Bank said recently. The IMF stated in a report published in October that the non-performing loan (NPL) rate was 4.6 percent in August. According to the World Bank, the NPL rate in microfinance institutions, which are assessed separately from commercial banks, stood at around 4 percent in mid-2023. Some reckon the NPL rate is higher than officially stated.\n\nAccording to the central bank, as of the end of 2022, some 14 percent of private loans were for home ownership, 9 percent were linked to the real estate sector, and 9 percent were for the construction sector – so more than a third of private debt is related to the housing market. One reason why the problem seems so much worse this year – and debt is the thing that most middle-class Cambodians now want to talk about – is because the government told banks and lenders to defer repayments during the pandemic. As such, NPLs that were obvious between 2020 and 2022 were rolled over. The saccharine Khmer Times and Phnom Penh Post are seemingly only allowed to be critical of anything in Cambodia when it comes to debt.\n\nOn the one hand, the Cambodian government is applauded for having a small national debt – around 36 percent of GDP at the last count. Certainly, Laos (with a debt of at least 120 percent of GDP) or Thailand (around 60 percent) look on with jealousy. And Manet’s government in recent weeks has tried to placate any alarm on this front. “Cambodia will not borrow beyond [its] means. We borrow to bolster our economy, not for purchasing luxury cars and airplanes. These loans serve our collective interests and will not result in the loss of our sovereignty to any country,” Hun Manet told a crowd on November 2.\n\nMinister of Economy and Finance Aun Pornmoniroth has also been busy reassuring the public and investors. This is partly a result of the recent public furor over taxation. As noted, everyone knows that government revenue and expenditure will rise, and if taxation isn’t going to pay for it (which Manet suggested, untruthfully), then it will have to come from more debt.\n\nOn the other hand, what the Cambodian government has done is to allow its citizens to take on the debt burden. It has relied on foreign governments (China and Japan, principally) and its own people to spur investment. Of course, the government can say it didn’t tell its people to indebt themselves so much. Indeed, much of it resulted from greed and speculation, as people took risky gambles. Nor, indeed, was the COVID-19 pandemic Phnom Penh’s fault. That said, neither did the government do too much to deter speculation and rapid debt accumulation in the 2010s. And there’s a reason why many Cambodians think they need to speculate on the property market: they don’t have pensions, healthcare is expensive, and the government’s narrative was that the good times wouldn’t end.\n\nHun Manet says he will unveil some new policies at the Government-Private Sector Forum later this month. My guess is that he’ll announce a proposal put forward earlier this year that allows foreigners to buy property in boreys, the gated communities where much of the toxic credit in the property sector is located. That might entice more private Chinese investors, especially now as capital flight from China is once again all the rage. (Some $49 billion left China in August, the largest amount since 2015.) It’s possible Hun Manet will also announce some other financial relief in the form of tax holidays and policy reforms.\n\nBut here’s the question: does private debt become state debt when it becomes too high? Earlier this year, the government gifted the property and construction sectors tax holidays and other benefits. But it’s worth considering what happens if the banking system does begin to crack, if NPLs rise too high. Does the government step in to offer bailouts, not just of the lenders but also borrowers? Does it sell off bonds to help the property sector? Does it interfere more directly? Will it require more cash handouts of the sort we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic? Considering that private debt accounts for more than 180 percent of GDP, how much toxic debt would the government be willing to buy up to write off? It doesn’t take much before you’re looking at the national debt soaring above the 50, 60 percent of GDP mark. When is something too big to fail?\n\nSpeaking in January, Vongsey Vissoth, now minister of the Council of Ministers and one of the new government’s most influential politicians, made a few interesting remarks, as reported by Voice of America. “Our problem is that real estate and construction can have a credit crunch, a lack of [access to] credit,” he said, adding that around 80 percent of property developers “depend on [credit from] the banking system and the cash flow from buyers… We must jointly solve this problem, it’s not merely about one individual [company].” Then, he added: “We don’t have the option to let this sector collapse because it’s a huge economic pillar.”\n\nBy David Hutt\nDavid Hutt is a journalist and commentator.

Same as the old boss. Or at least that is the consensus of many observers one year into Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet’s tenure.\n\nIt comes as little surprise that Hun Sen’s eldest son is maintaining the status quo of his predecessor who led the Southeast Asian nation for almost four decades.\n\nBut what have these inaugural 12 months in charge meant for Cambodia’s economy— and its hugely significant real estate and construction sector?\n\nFollowing an initially sluggish recovery from the pandemic, the Asian Development Bank expects Cambodia’s economy to grow by 5.8 percent in 2024. Still, the figure is some way off the pre-Covid annual growth rate of 7.6 percent between 1995 and 2019.\n\nA key factor for this relative slowdown is the poor performance of the country’s real estate and construction sector, which reportedly contributes about 10 percent to GDP. The sector grew by only 0.5 percent in 2023 and 0.2 percent in 2022, and the Cambodian Valuers and Estate Agents Association (CVEA) says it may take another three years to reach pre-pandemic levels.\n\n“Everything always has a history and a journey. I believe improvement will come around 2026-27, possibly mirroring the peak conditions of 2018-19,” notes Sorn Seap, the CVEA chairman and chairperson of the PropertyGuru Cambodia Property Awards’ judging panel.\n\nAmongst the major issues currently facing the industry is the soaring inventory levels. As of Q3 2023, the capital Phnom Penh was home to more than 53,000 completed condominium units. The high supply has considerably intensified competition, particularly in the condominium market.\n\nThis has exerted considerable pressure on pricing and occupancy rates, with developers and landlords competing fiercely with one another for the same pool of tenants. Subsequently, 2023 witnessed the lowest number of landed property launches in Cambodia in a decade, according to Lawrence Lennon, managing director of CBRE Cambodia.\n\n“It’s great if you’re a consumer, a buyer or a renter, there’s never been a better time to find quality stock, quality shopping malls, quality offices, great condominiums and great locations, but the reality is, if you’re on the sell-side, if you’re a landlord, it’s very challenging,” he said at a CBRE event earlier this year.\n\nA wider concern for the country’s coffers is the rise in personal debt in recent years. As of late 2023, consumer finance debt reached a record high of more than USD 15 billion, according to the Credit Bureau of Cambodia, with an increase in late payments, indicating rising default risks, especially in personal finance loans.\nThe economic conditions affecting borrowers’ ability to service their debts further complicate the situation. High levels of debt in Cambodia’s real estate sector highlight the challenges of financial management among consumers and reflect broader economic vulnerabilities, with the World Bank recently noting that it could impact the nation’s macro-financial stability.\n\nThe government is already working with the National Bank of Cambodia to implement stricter lending regulations in response to the high levels of personal and corporate debt, particularly within the real estate sector. These measures are designed to curb excessive borrowing and ensure financial institutions engage in responsible lending practices.\n\nElsewhere, Hun Manet’s government has continued to encourage foreign investment to boost the sector. This includes relaxing certain regulations to make it easier for foreign investors to purchase property and invest in large-scale projects, as well as allowing foreigners to use Cambodian representatives for property purchases, where the land titles would list a Cambodian as the owner, but separate contracts would protect the foreign investor’s interests.\n\n“The new policies include significant tax incentives, particularly for properties below USD70,000, making ownership transfer dutyfree, and allowing developers to reduce tax payments by splitting them into manageable amounts,” explains Seap.\n\nHe adds that Sihanoukville will likely benefit from these initiatives. Before the pandemic, the city had become a hotbed for Chinese investors, reshaping its economy and landscape with the rapid construction of buildings and casinos. This growth, however, led to challenges including environmental damage, labour issues, and displacement of locals. The retreat of investors due to Covid-19 and China’s overseas gambling restrictions then left the city with numerous\n\n“Promising real estate markets are those with well-developed transportation infrastructure and the potential for owners to earn quick returns or high profits,” according to Seap. “In particular, coastal Preah Sihanouk province, which currently has many unfinished projects, will experience rapid growth in the future. This belief is based on the patterns observed in the Chinese real estate market, where rapid development often begins in coastal cities.”\n\nAs Hun Manet’s first year at the helm concludes, the sector remains a mixed bag of challenges and gradual revitalisations. Initiatives to attract foreign investment and manage soaring personal debt at least reflect a nuanced approach to economic stewardship. And with significant policies targeting areas like Sihanoukville, cautious optimism abounds for a recovery in an industry that remains essential to the country’s economic growth.\n\nThis article was originally published on asiarealestatesummit.com.

Here are essential steps to follow:\n\n### 1. **Research and Set a Budget**\n   - Determine how much you are willing to spend, including taxes, registration, insurance, and potential repairs.\n   - Research different models that fit your budget and needs. Consider factors like reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and resale value.\n\n### 2. **Find the Right Car**\n   - Use online marketplaces, dealerships, and classified ads to find cars that match your criteria.\n   - Narrow down your choices based on the car’s age, mileage, features, and condition.\n\n### 3. **Check the Vehicle History Report**\n   - Obtain a vehicle history report (e.g., from Carfax or AutoCheck) to check for accidents, title issues, previous owners, and service records.\n   - Avoid cars with a salvage title or a history of major accidents.\n\n### 4. **Inspect the Car Physically**\n   - Look for signs of rust, dents, or mismatched paint that could indicate previous damage.\n   - Inspect the tires, lights, mirrors, windows, and other exterior components.\n   - Check for any fluid leaks underneath the car.\n\n### 5. **Inspect the Interior**\n   - Check the condition of the seats, dashboard, and other interior components for wear and tear.\n   - Ensure all electronics (e.g., air conditioning, radio, windows) are functioning properly.\n\n### 6. **Check the Engine and Under the Hood**\n   - Look for signs of corrosion, leaks, or worn-out parts.\n   - Inspect the belts and hoses for cracks or wear.\n   - Check the oil, coolant, and other fluid levels.\n\n### 7. **Test Drive the Car**\n   - Take the car for a test drive on various roads (highways, local streets) to assess its performance.\n   - Pay attention to how it accelerates, brakes, steers, and handles.\n   - Listen for unusual noises from the engine, brakes, or suspension.\n\n### 8. **Get a Professional Mechanical Inspection**\n   - Hire a trusted mechanic to perform a thorough inspection of the car.\n   - A mechanic can identify issues that may not be visible to an untrained eye, potentially saving you from future costly repairs.\n\n### 9. **Check the Odometer Reading**\n   - Compare the odometer reading with the car’s age and service records. Excessive mileage for the car’s age can indicate heavy usage.\n\n### 10. **Negotiate the Price**\n   - Use the information gathered from your research and inspection to negotiate a fair price.\n   - Be prepared to walk away if the seller is not willing to negotiate or if there are any red flags.\n\n### 11. **Verify Ownership and Paperwork**\n   - Ensure that the seller has a clear title to the car and that there are no outstanding liens.\n   - Verify all necessary documents (registration, title, service records) are available and in order.\n\n### 12. **Close the Deal**\n   - Complete all necessary paperwork, including a bill of sale and transfer of ownership.\n   - Ensure you receive all keys, manuals, and any remaining warranty documents.\n\nBy following these steps, you can minimize the risks and increase the chances of buying a reliable used car that suits your needs and budget.","type":"auto","countryCode":"KH","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725167372060"}},"createdUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR","updatedAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725167623560"}},"updatedUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR","url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/bayonapp-2021.appspot.com/o/notification2024090111433812step.jpg?alt=media&token=cfc1c7a8-eab8-43c9-a87d-0628da4be127"}

{"_id":"vsm3cZu5nXPAEYg8i","title":"Cambodia Real Estate Market Update 2024","body":"Over the past nine months, Cambodia's real estate market has shown mixed trends, influenced by both economic growth and sector-specific challenges.\n\n1. Economic Growth and Market Dynamics: Cambodia's GDP is expected to grow by around 5.8% in 2024, supported by a rebound in tourism, which saw 2.6 million international arrivals by mid-2024. However, the construction sector faced a decline in investment approvals, with a reported $786 million in Q1 2024, reflecting caution among developers.\n\n2. Phnom Penh Real Estate: The real estate market in Phnom Penh continues to show resilience, particularly in the office and condominium sectors. Office space demand remains robust, with rental rates remaining competitive compared to regional cities like Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City. Despite a significant increase in supply, with over 198,000 square meters of new office space expected in 2024, the occupancy rate is stable, indicating sustained demand.\n\n3. Residential and Condominium Developments: The residential market, particularly condominiums, remains active, with several high-profile projects set to complete in 2024. Notable developments include Le Conde BKK1 and Diamond Bay Gardens, which are among the tallest buildings in Phnom Penh. These projects cater to various residential needs, with amenities that target the mid to high-end market segments.\n\n4. Challenges and Opportunities: The market has also seen a shift towards more data-driven valuations and strategic decision-making, as the market correction of 2023 has made investors more cautious. New construction guidelines expected in 2024 aim to align Cambodia’s building standards with international norms, which could enhance investor confidence.\n\nOverall, while the Cambodian real estate market faces challenges, particularly in the construction sector, the outlook remains positive with ongoing developments and strong demand in key areas like Phnom Penh.\n\n-----\nSponsor Call: 099262715/012207006\nTelegram https://t.me/bayonappplatform\nFB Group https://facebook.com/groups/bayonapp\nDownload APP https://app.bayonapp.com\nFacebook Page https://www.facebook.com/bayonapp.info\n-----","type":"estate","url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/bayonapp-2021.appspot.com/o/notification20240904083229Cambodia-RealEstate-Last-Update.png?alt=media&token=75bb8a52-a28b-4f18-8435-b2d8810a8caa","countryCode":"KH","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725415411854"}},"createdUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR"}

{"_id":"bfav55B74buKCkJ4s","title":"ASAN Real Estate Market Summary 2024","body":"The real estate market trends in Asia vary across countries, influenced by factors such as economic growth, urbanization, government policies, and foreign investment. Here's a summary of key trends across various Asian countries:\n\nChina: The property market has been experiencing a downturn due to government measures to reduce debt and curb speculative buying. Property developers face liquidity issues, and housing prices have stagnated or declined in many regions. However, recent government support aims to stabilize the sector.\n\nIndia: India’s real estate market is recovering post-pandemic, with demand rising in both residential and commercial segments. Key factors include urbanization, affordable housing schemes, and increased interest from foreign investors. The market is expected to see further growth in Tier II and III cities.\n\nJapan: Japan’s real estate market remains stable, driven by low interest rates and strong demand in the commercial sector, especially in Tokyo. Residential demand is more subdued due to an aging population and shrinking workforce. However, foreign investors continue to see Japan as a safe investment destination.\n\nSouth Korea: South Korea’s real estate market has seen rapid price increases, especially in Seoul. Government regulations, including taxes on multiple properties and lending restrictions, have been implemented to cool the market. The focus has shifted to ensuring affordable housing for younger generations.\n\nSingapore: Singapore’s property market is thriving, with strong demand from both local and foreign buyers. The government has introduced cooling measures like additional buyer’s stamp duty to prevent overheating. Luxury real estate and commercial properties remain attractive to international investors.\n\nVietnam: Vietnam’s real estate market is growing rapidly, fueled by foreign direct investment, economic expansion, and urbanization. Key areas of development include industrial parks, residential apartments, and hospitality projects in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.\n\nThailand: Thailand’s property market has shown resilience despite the pandemic, especially in the residential and tourism sectors. There is growing interest in condominiums, with foreign buyers playing a significant role, especially from China. However, oversupply in some regions remains a concern.\n\nMalaysia: The Malaysian market is recovering slowly from the pandemic, with government incentives like the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) boosting residential sales. The affordable housing segment is seeing increased demand, while the commercial sector faces oversupply issues.\n\nIndonesia: Indonesia’s real estate sector is seeing moderate growth, with strong demand in affordable housing. Major cities like Jakarta and Bali attract both domestic and foreign investors. The government is focusing on infrastructure development, which will boost real estate opportunities.\n\nPhilippines: The Philippines' real estate market is on an upward trajectory, driven by strong demand for residential and commercial properties, especially in Metro Manila. The BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) sector and remittances from overseas workers contribute significantly to market growth.\n\nCambodia: Cambodia's real estate sector is expanding rapidly, with strong foreign investment, particularly from China. The focus is on urban areas like Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, where residential and commercial developments are booming.\n\nAcross Asia, the common trends include increasing urbanization, government policies to manage market volatility, and growing foreign investment. The demand for affordable housing, sustainable developments, and mixed-use properties is also on the rise in many countries.\n\n-----\nSponsor Call: 099262715/012207006\nTelegram https://t.me/bayonappplatform\nFB Group https://facebook.com/groups/bayonapp\nDownload APP https://app.bayonapp.com\nFacebook Page https://www.facebook.com/bayonapp.info","type":"estate","url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/bayonapp-2021.appspot.com/o/notification20240905153915ASIANREALESTATESTATUS.png?alt=media&token=0312dc07-e8a4-4dee-8cf1-b26efe45f47b","countryCode":"KH","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1725527382842"}},"createdUser":"ntomJY7RRbKDFyoBR"}
